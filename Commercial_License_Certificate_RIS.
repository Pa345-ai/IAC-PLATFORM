WHEREAS, the Licensor is the exclusive and sole owner of the Enterprise AWS ECS Fargate Infrastructure Framework (46-Node Edition), a proprietary software infrastructure framework (the "Framework"), and has developed certain architectural patterns, HCL/Terraform source code, and related intellectual property (collectively, the "Licensed Materials");

This license shall not extend to any other use, including resale, sublicensing, distribution, or any other commercial activity outside the scope explicitly provided herein.
1.2 Scope of Use:
a. The Purchaser is authorized to deploy the Licensed Materials for the purpose of managing and optimizing the Purchaser's internal corporate projects and production environments.
b. The Purchaser is granted the right to modify the HCL/Terraform source code and architectural patterns to suit the Purchaser's specific internal business requirements, provided such modifications are for internal use only and do not result in the creation of any derivative works intended for external distribution.
c. The Purchaser may utilize the architectural patterns provided with the Licensed Materials for any internal sub-domains that fall under the Purchaser’s organization.

c. The Purchaser shall not claim ownership of the original "Hardened 46-Node" baseline or any other part of the Licensed Materials, nor shall the Purchaser falsely represent that they have developed the framework or components as their own work, for purposes of resale or redistribution.

2.2 Intellectual Property Retention: The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that all rights, title, and interest in the underlying intellectual property of the Licensed Materials, including but not limited to the architectural logic, security-hardened patterns, logical dependency mapping, HCL/Terraform code, and all related documentation and modifications, remain the exclusive intellectual property of the Licensor.

The Purchaser and any third parties are expressly prohibited from claiming ownership over the Licensed Materials, whether directly or indirectly, including any claim to the creation or ownership of a repository that may be created prior to the Licensor’s original work.
